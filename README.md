# TPGsim
This is a practice tool for RotMG Shatter's "Test of Patience" phase. Speed, health points, defense, and difficulty are all adjustable. 

In addition, there is both a solo mode and a group mode. In solo mode, the shades will aggro the player while in group mode, the shades will move as if being dragged in a large raid.

## How to use
Go to [releases](https://github.com/Mxple/TPGsim/releases) and download the latest version. If you wish to build from the source code, download this repository as a zip, and use Gamemaker Studio 2.3+ to compile the project from the yyz.

For mac users, there will not be a release. Apparently, to share the .dmg file, an Apple Developer ID is required which is not free. Instead, you can run this on WINE. If you are able to open damaged .dmg files with a bit of trickery though, DM me on discord (RIN#7777) and I'll send you a file.

## Tips
Hold shift while clicking to increment stats quicker. There is no end to this simulator - if you die, the game just restarts. You can judge whether you finished a patience by counting the number of drags. 3 for normal, 4 for hard mode.
Screen rotate is available as well as camera offset. All controls are default for now. QOL changes may or may not be expected.

## FAQ
Q: I don't like the default skin, will you add more skin options?

A: naur.
